CARLA Simulator
===============

CARLA is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. CARLA has
been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and
validation of autonomous urban driving systems. In addition to open-source code
and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings,
vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The
simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and
environmental conditions.

Roadmap
-------

We are continuously working on improving CARLA, and we appreciate contributions from the community.
Our most immediate goals are:
- Releasing the methods evaluated in the CARLA paper
- Adding a LiDAR sensor
- Allowing for flexible and user-friendly import and editing of maps
- Allowing the users to control non-player characters (and therefore set up user-specified scenarios)

We will post a detailed roadmap and contribution guidelines soon - stay tuned!
