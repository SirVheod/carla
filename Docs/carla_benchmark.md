CARLA Benchmark
===============

Running the Benchmark
-------------------------
The "carla" api provides a basic benchmarking system, that allows making
several tests on a certain agent. We already provide the same benchmark
used in the CoRL 2017 paper. By running this benchmark you can compare
the results of your agent to the results obtained by the agents
show in the paper. 

! Currently not tested on python 3

Besides the requirements of the CARLA client,
the benchmark package also needs the future package
    $ sudo pip install future

Run the help command to see options available
    $ ./run_benchmark --help
