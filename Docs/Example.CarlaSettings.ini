; Example of settings file for CARLA.
;
; This file can be loaded with the Python client to be sent to the server. It
; defines the parameters to be used when requesting a new episode.
;
; Note that server specific variables are loaded in server only. Use it with
; `./CarlaUE4.sh -carla-settings=Path/To/This/File`.

[CARLA/Server]
; If set to false, a mock controller will be used instead of waiting for a real
; client to connect. (Server only)
UseNetworking=true
; Ports to use for the server-client communication. This can be overridden by
; the command-line switch `-world-port=N`, write and read ports will be set to
; N+1 and N+2 respectively. (Server only)
WorldPort=2000
; Time-out in milliseconds for the networking operations. (Server only)
ServerTimeOut=10000
; In synchronous mode, CARLA waits every frame until the control from the client
; is received.
SynchronousMode=true
; Send info about every non-player agent in the scene every frame, the
; information is attached to the measurements message. This includes other
; vehicles, pedestrians and traffic signs. Disabled by default to improve
; performance.
SendNonPlayerAgentsInfo=false

[CARLA/LevelSettings]
; Path of the vehicle class to be used for the player. Leave empty for default.
; Paths follow the pattern "/Game/Blueprints/Vehicles/Mustang/Mustang.Mustang_C"

; Index of the weather/lighting presets to use. If negative, the default presets
; of the map will be used.

; Seeds for the pseudo-random number generators.

[CARLA/Sensor]
; Names of the sensors to be attached to the player, comma-separated, each of
; them should be defined in its own subsection.

; Uncomment next line to add a camera called MyCamera to the vehicle
; Sensors=MyCamera

; or uncomment next line to add a camera and a LiDAR
; Sensors=MyCamera,MyLidar

; or uncomment next line to add a regular camera and a depth camera
; Sensors=MyCamera,MyCamera/Depth

; Now, every camera we added needs to be defined it in its own subsection.
[CARLA/Sensor/MyCamera]
; Type of the sensor. The available types are:
;   * CAMERA_NONE                   No effects applied.
;   * CAMERA_SCENE_FINAL            Post-processing present at scene (bloom, fog, etc).
;   * CAMERA_DEPTH                  Depth map ground-truth only.
;   * CAMERA_SEMANTIC_SEGMENTATION  Semantic segmentation ground-truth only.
;   * LIDAR_RAY_TRACE               A LiDAR implementation based on ray-tracing.
SensorType=CAMERA_SCENE_FINAL
; Size of the captured image in pixels.
ImageSizeX=800
ImageSizeY=600
; Camera (horizontal) field of view in degrees.
FOV=90
; Position of the camera relative to the car in centimeters.
PositionX=15
PositionY=0
PositionZ=123
; Rotation of the camera relative to the car in degrees.
RotationPitch=8
RotationRoll=0
RotationYaw=0

[CARLA/Sensor/MyCamera/Depth]
; The sensor can be defined in a subsection of MyCamera so it inherits the
; values in MyCamera. This adds a camera similar to MyCamera but generating
; depth map images instead.
SensorType=CAMERA_DEPTH

[CARLA/Sensor/MyLidar]
SensorType=LIDAR_RAY_TRACE
; Number of lasers.
Channels=32
; Measure distance in centimeters.
Range=5000
; Points generated by all lasers per second.
PointsPerSecond=100000
; Lidar rotation frequency.
RotationFrequency=10
; Upper and lower laser angles, positive values means above horizontal line.
UpperFOVLimit=10
LowerFOVLimit=-30
; Position and rotation relative to the vehicle.
PositionX=0
PositionY=0
PositionZ=140
